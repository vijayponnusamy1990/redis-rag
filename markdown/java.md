Learn Java
==========

Running Your First Java Application
-----------------------------------

*   Getting Started with Java  

Downloading and setting up the JDK, writing your first Java class, and creating your first Java application.

*   Launching Single-File Source-Code Programs  

Launching Single-File Source-Code Java programs with the Java launcher.

*   JShell - The Java Shell Tool  

jshell interactively evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions of the Java programming language in a read-eval-print loop (REPL).

*   Building a Java application in Visual Studio Code  

Oracle Java Platform extension enables you to develop your Maven and Gradle Java project in Visual Studio Code.

*   Building a Java application in IntelliJ IDEA  

Learn how to code, run, test, debug and document a Java application in IntelliJ IDEA.

*   Building a Java Application in the Eclipse IDE  

Installing and getting started with the Eclipse IDE for developing Java applications

Staying Aware of New Features
-----------------------------

*   Java Platform Evolution  

Java has come a long ways since Java 8. Let's go over some of this evolution.

*   Using the Preview Features Available in the JDK  

How to compile and execute the preview features available in the JDK.

Getting to Know the Language
----------------------------

*   Objects, Classes, Interfaces, Packages, and Inheritance  

Introducing the object oriented programming.

*   Java Language Basics  

Getting to know the basics of the Java language.

*   Classes and Objects  

Defining your own classes, declaring member variables, methods, and constructors.

*   Using Record to Model Immutable Data  

How to model your immutable data with records to make your code simpler and more readable.

*   Numbers and Strings  

Understanding numbers, characters and strings of characters.

*   Inheritance  

Leveraging inheritance in Java applications.

*   Interfaces  

Creating and using interfaces.

*   Generics  

Working with parameterized types.

*   Lambda Expressions  

Using Lambda Expressions to improve the readability of your code.

*   Annotations  

Annotations is a form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. Annotations have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate.

*   Packages  

How to bundle classes and interfaces into packages, how to use classes that are in packages, and how to arrange your file system so that the compiler can find your source files.

*   Using Pattern Matching  

Pattern matching is the next major evolution of the Java language. It brings new features, one by one, that greatly improve the way you can write your Java code.

*   Exceptions  

Using exceptions to handle errors and other exceptional events.

*   Refactoring from the Imperative to the Functional Style  

Learning to change code from the Imperative to the Functional Style.

Mastering the API
-----------------

*   The Collections Framework  

Getting to know the Collections Framework to store and retrieve data in collections and hashmaps.

*   The Stream API  

Process your in-memory data with Java streams and collectors. Process them faster with parallel streams.

*   The Java I/O API  

Access external resources with the Java Input / Output API.

*   Common I/O Tasks in Modern Java  

This article focuses on tasks that application programmers are likely to encounter, particularly in web applications, such as reading and writing text files, reading text, images, JSON from the web, and more.

*   The Date Time API  

Covers the Date Time API added to the JDK 8, including the core concepts and classes.

*   Regular Expressions  

Provides a general overview of regular expressions. It also introduces the core classes that comprise this API.

*   Introduction to Java Reflection  

Java reflection allows an object to look in the mirror and discover what fields, methods, and constructors it has. We can read and write fields, invoke methods, and even create new objects by calling the constructors.

*   The Reflection API  

Let us deep dive in to the Reflection API, and see how you can use it to examine or modify the runtime behavior of applications running in the Java Virtual Machine.

*   Introduction to Method Handles  

Method handles, how they are different from the Reflection API, and the tooling they provide.

*   Fundamentals of Security using JDK Libraries  

Provides a general overview of security APIs. It also introduces the core components part of this API.

*   Virtual Threads  

Virtual Threads: What, Why, and How?

*   The Foreign Function and Memory API  

The Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API facilitates Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside the Java runtime without the brittleness and danger of JNI.

Organizing your Application
---------------------------

*   Modules  

Understand how the module system shapes the JDK and how you can use it to make your code base more maintainable.

*   Creating Runtime and Application Images with JLink  

Learn how to use the command line tool `jlink` to create custom-made runtime images or self-contained application images.
